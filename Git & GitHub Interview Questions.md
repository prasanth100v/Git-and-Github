# 🔥 Git & GitHub Interview Questions (Real Scenarios)
## 1️⃣ Scenario: You modified a file but don’t want to commit yet. What do you do?
  I keep the changes in my working directory **or** use **git stash** if I need to switch tasks. 
     Stash temporarily saves my work without committing.

## 2️⃣ Scenario: You accidentally committed sensitive data. What’s your fix?
 If it’s not pushed, I use git reset to remove the commit. If it’s already pushed, 
     I use git revert to safely undo without rewriting history.
