# 🔧 DevOps-Specific GitHub Interview Questions (with Real Examples)
### 🏆 FINAL DEVOPS INTERVIEW ANSWER (Golden)
In DevOps, I use GitHub as the single source of truth. I automate CI with GitHub Actions for build, test, and security checks, and I use Argo CD for GitOps-based CD on AWS EKS. Infrastructure is managed as code using Terraform and Kubernetes manifests. Production is protected through pull-request reviews, branch protection rules, and mandatory CI checks, enabling fast, reliable, and auditable safe deployments.”


### 🔥 DevOps-Specific Example (EKS + GitOps)
“When a PR is merged into main, Argo CD automatically syncs the changes to EKS. Branch protection ensures only reviewed and tested code reaches production.”

### 🏆 Final Interview-Ready Summary
In DevOps, Git acts as the source of truth for both application and infrastructure code. I use branch-based workflows, PR reviews, protected branches, and tags to enable safe deployments, fast rollbacks, and full auditability.
