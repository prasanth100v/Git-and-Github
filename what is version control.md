# What is version control?
Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, so you can:
```
See what changed
See who changed it
Go back to any previous version
Work with others safely on the same project
```
# What is a commit?
### A commit is: A snapshot of your project at a point in time
 **Each commit = one version of your code.**
Example:
```
Commit 1: Added login page
Commit 2: Fixed login bug
Commit 3: Improved UI
```
### 👉 Version control = history
### 👉 Commit = one saved point in that history
