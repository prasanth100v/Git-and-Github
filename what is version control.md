# What is version control?
Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, so you can:
**See what changed**
**See who changed it**
**Go back to any previous version**
**Work with others safely on the same project**

# What is a commit?
### A commit is: A snapshot of your project at a point in time
 **Each commit = one version of your code.**
